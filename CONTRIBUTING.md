# Contributing to Minecraft-info-bot
Every contribution is well accepted but has to respect the following guidelines:
1. Think before opening a new request. How can your edit improve the bot? Has it already been implemented? Since every request has to and will be reviewed, don't hesitate to create a new pull request if you're not sure
2. To contribute, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository and create a new branch where you can make the changes you want
3. Do not use offensive or rude language
4. Every commit message must use the following format:\
Summary of the changes.\
Blank line\
A more detailed description of the changes. You can organise your message in paragraphs using a '-' symbol at the start of every chapter
5. Test EVERY functionality in your new version with your API key. Please, don't create pull requests for incomplete or faulty updates. Take as much time as you need to be sure you don't need and want to add anything else to the update, so that you don't send a pull request immediately after because you forgot to add something
6. Remove any testing file or private information such as API keys
7. Once you're done testing, press the `Compare & pull request` button in your cloned repository and add a complete comment and title
